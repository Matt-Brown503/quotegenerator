Following the projects for Free Code Camp, I made a fun random word generator. 

I wanted to use a API to generate quotes via AXAX reuests but ended up using arrays due to time.

This project was a lot of fun and I probably spent more time making it display nice than I needed to.
Coming from an art background I cant help myself when considering design.
